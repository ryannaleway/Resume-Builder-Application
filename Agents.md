## Coding Conventions

  - **Hungarian Notation**: Use Hungarian notation for variable naming

  - **camelCase**: use camelCase when naming all variables

  - **Async Javascript**: Prefer to use async await rather than .then when performing javascript functions

  - **No Build Tools**: Avoid build tools such as Babel, Webpack, or Vite unless it is explicitly required. Code must run either directly in the browser or via NodeJS.

  - **Dependencies**: Do not add external libraries such as jQuery without approval. Prefer native Web APIs

  - **ECMAScript Version**: Target ES6+ features including arrow functions and template literals as well as promises

  - **External Libraries Local**: All external libraries that are included must not use a CDN but rather be included in project source files

  - **Bootstrap Utility Classes**: Use only standard Bootstrap 5+ utility classes for layout, spacing, and colors. Avoid creating custom CSS classes or inline styles unless the design cannot be achieved without them.

  - **Comments**: Provide verbose comments to explain the flow of the code, and anything that would be difficult for a beginner developer to understand

 

## Accessibility

  - **Standards**: All user interfaces must meet WCAG 2.1+ accessibility standards

  - **Alt tags**: All images must also have an alt tag attribute that describes the image

  - **Priority**: Prioritize accessibility over design

  - **ARIA Labels**: Include aria labels on ALL HTML form controls

 

## Project Structure

  - **Entry Point**: All nodeJS applications must use server.js for entry point

  - **API Routes**: All API routes must be included in the /api/ routing

 

## API Requirements

  - **RESTful**: All API routes should be RESTful in design

  - **UPDATE**: All UPDATE routes should use PUT rather than PATCH

  - **DELETE**: DELETE routes should use URL parameters for primary key indicators

  - **SELECT**: All user inputs for SELECT should be passed via URL query strings

  - **CREATE**: All user inputs for CREATES should be passed via JSON body data

  - **Input Validation**: All user-passed inputs should be validated

  - **SELECT RETURN**: All SELECT should return JSON arrays

  - **Status Codes**: Every route should return appropriate HTTP status codes for both success and error

 

## DO NOT

  - Do not hardcode credentials

  - Do not intermix user inputs in queries, require prepared statements

  - Do not skip input validation

 

## Decision Guidelines

  - Prefer simpler, less complex and maintainable code

  - Ask for clarification if uncertain

 

## Testing

  - Ensure All GET API routes return JSON arrays

  - Handle any missing input data with proper error messaging

  - POST and PUT routes should validate all required fields
